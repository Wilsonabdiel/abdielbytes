                    <p>My name is Abdiel. </p>
                    <p>I am a web developer and a writer well versed
                        in the beauty of the backend with knowlegde of the frontend.</p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy problem-solving and creating visually
                        appealing and user-friendly interfaces,
                        and well perfroming, scallable and secure backends.
                        My passion for learning is insatiable. I thrive on acquiring new
                        knowledge and skills. Writing has always held a
                        special place in my heart, it is a hobby
                        I have cherished since high school, where my
                        teachers praised my work. I am not just a coder,
                        I am also a poet, expressing my thoughts through words.
                        Additionally, I have a deep passion for food,
                        savoring both the culinary art and its cultural significance!
